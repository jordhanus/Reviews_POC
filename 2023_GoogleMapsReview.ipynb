    "### Basic logic\n",
    "- The app ingests a series of reviews (or other customer feedback, or indeed any form of text) and a number of user-defined categories to assess the text input on. The output is in the form of a written assessment in English of max. 50 characters and an integer score of 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive) for each of the categories. \n",
    "- The script is tailored for (somewhat) larger datasets that require batching of the input: since every LLM has a fixed token window, the input and output of any call to the LLM has to stay within the token window to be processed in full. For the LLM used here, gpt-3.5-turbo, the token window is 4,096. The function create_batches below ensures that given the length of each review and the number of categories, batches are created that fall neatly within the token window.\n",
    "- The final output is a simple panel app, requiring the categories to be inputted. A sanity check then first provides an estimate of the associated cost (gtp-3.5-turbo doesn't come for free, alas), before executing the full script.\n",
