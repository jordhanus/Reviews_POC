During the past year, Large Languague Models (LLM) have developed an incredible track record. Their innate ability to understand natural language in close to six million forms of communication has lead to a myriad of applications. However, structured replies are harder to come by. If you want to input hundreds or thousands of records for a task and then store away a range of outputs in a database, things become trickier. Luckily, OpenAIs relatively recent models, such as gpt-3.5-turbo, are great at providing their output in JSON. With proper prompting and supporting scripting, this allows for a structured pipeline leading to structured output.\n
In this repository I show a simple 'app' to analyse Google Maps Reviews, although it can easily be extended to all other kinds of texts. The basic logic is that the app digests a series of reviews (or other documents) and then asesses each of them on a series of custom-made categories ('Friendliness of staff', 'Quality of delivery', 'Speed of service', etc.). The app gives for each review and each category both a written evaluation (for now set at max. 50 characters, in English) and a score ranging from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).\n
The magic of LLMs is that they understand every language: the data, the categories, the asked-for evaluation, all can be done in almost any language.
