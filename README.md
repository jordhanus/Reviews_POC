During the past year, Large Languague Models (LLM) have developed an incredible track record. Their innate ability to understand natural language in close to six million forms of communication has lead to a myriad of applications. However, structured replies are harder to come by. If you want to input hundreds or thousands of records for a task and then store away a range of outputs in a database, things become trickier. Luckily, OpenAIs relatively recent models, such as gpt-3.5-turbo, are great at providing their output in JSON. With proper prompting and supporting scripting, this allows for a structured pipeline leading to structured output.
